# AI Safety Security Analysis Working Document

## Document Overview
Based on the FLI AI Safety Index Report (Summer 2025), this document catalogs security concerns, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities identified in current AI systems and development practices.

## Executive Summary
The report reveals critical gaps in AI safety infrastructure, with no company achieving higher than C+ grade. Key finding: **"The industry is fundamentally unprepared for its own stated goals"** despite racing toward AGI within the decade.

## SECURITY CONCERNS

### 1. **Inadequate Risk Management Infrastructure**
- **Critical Gap**: Companies racing toward AGI but lack "coherent, actionable plan" for control
- **Scope**: All 7 assessed companies scored D or below in Existential Safety planning
- **Impact**: Expert assessment shows "very low confidence that dangerous capabilities are being detected in time to prevent significant harm"

### 2. **Insufficient External Oversight**
- **Lack of Independent Verification**: No companies commission independent verification of safety evaluations
- **Limited External Testing**: Only 3/7 companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind) conduct substantive testing for dangerous capabilities
- **NDA Restrictions**: External evaluators bound by NDAs, limiting transparency

### 3. **Capabilities Acceleration vs Safety Preparedness Gap**
- **Accelerating Development**: Capabilities advancing faster than risk management practices
- **Widening Industry Gap**: No common regulatory floor allows some companies to neglect basic safeguards
- **Competitive Pressure**: Safety infrastructure lagging behind technological ambition

### 4. **Governance and Accountability Deficits**
- **Whistleblowing Policy Gap**: Only OpenAI published full whistleblowing policy (after media pressure)
- **Restrictive NDAs**: Use of non-disclosure agreements tied to employee equity
- **Regulatory Resistance**: Some companies actively lobbying against AI safety regulations

### 5. **Information Sharing Limitations**
- **System Prompt Secrecy**: Most companies keep system prompts secret
- **Absent Incident Reporting**: No concrete public processes for notifying governments about critical incidents
- **Limited Transparency**: Methodology linking evaluations to specific risks often absent

## ATTACK VECTORS

### 1. **Jailbreaking and Adversarial Attacks**
- **Current Vulnerability**: All models remain vulnerable to jailbreaks and misuse
- **Extreme Cases**: DeepSeek has "extreme jailbreak vulnerability"
- **Automated Attacks**: Cisco Security Risk Evaluation shows vulnerability to automated jailbreaking
- **Safeguard Bypass**: Fine-tuning can disable safety mechanisms (especially problematic for open-weight models)

### 2. **Dangerous Capability Exploitation**
- **Bio-terrorism Risks**: Only Anthropic conducted human participant bio-risk trials
- **Cyber-terrorism Capabilities**: Limited testing for cyber-offense capabilities
- **Autonomous Replication**: Insufficient assessment of autonomous replication risks
- **Influence Operations**: Limited evaluation of models' potential for influence operations

### 3. **Model Weight Security Risks**
- **Open-Weight Vulnerabilities**: Meta, Zhipu AI, and DeepSeek releasing model weights enables malicious actors to remove safety protections
- **Fine-tuning Exploitation**: Released weights allow bad actors to fine-tune away safety measures
- **Tamper-Resistant Safeguard Gaps**: Insufficient investment in tamper-resistant safeguards for open-weight models

### 4. **Human Uplift Attack Scenarios**
- **Capability Enhancement**: AI systems may increase users' ability to cause real-world harm
- **Limited Testing**: Only Anthropic conducting controlled experiments to measure human uplift effects
- **Unknown Risk Amplification**: Most companies not assessing how AI might amplify human harmful capabilities

### 5. **Misalignment and Control Loss**
- **Scheming/Deception**: Limited research on AI systems engaging in deceptive behavior
- **Alignment Faking**: Insufficient detection mechanisms for models pretending to be aligned
- **Scalable Oversight Gap**: Lack of robust methods for overseeing increasingly capable systems

## VULNERABILITIES

### 1. **Risk Assessment Methodological Flaws**
- **Lack of Methodological Rigor**: "Methodology/reasoning explicitly linking evaluation to risk usually absent"
- **Missing Risk-Assessment Standards**: Evaluations don't meet basic risk assessment literature standards
- **No Quantitative Guarantees**: Absence of formal safety proofs or probabilistic risk bounds
- **Pre-mitigation vs Post-mitigation**: Some companies only assess risks after applying mitigations

### 2. **Safety Framework Implementation Gaps**
- **Limited Risk Scope**: Frameworks address very limited scope of potential risks
- **No External Enforcement**: Lack of reliable enforcement mechanisms for safety commitments
- **Undefined Trigger Thresholds**: No concrete, externally verifiable trigger thresholds for deployment pauses
- **Seoul Commitment Gaps**: Despite signing commitments, concrete implementation plans missing

### 3. **Technical Safety Research Deficiencies**
- **Interpretability Limitations**: Over-reliance on mechanistic interpretability (early-stage discipline)
- **Alignment Research Gaps**: Most companies producing little concrete technical research for extreme risks
- **Safety Team Capacity Loss**: Some companies (notably OpenAI) experiencing high safety team turnover
- **External Safety Research Support**: Limited support for independent AI safety research

### 4. **Model Deployment Vulnerabilities**
- **Insufficient Pre-deployment Testing**: Limited meaningful access for independent experts to test models before release
- **Bug Bounty Gaps**: Most companies lack structured incentives for discovering safety issues
- **Model Card Inadequacies**: Quality improvements marginal, underlying methodology still insufficient
- **Watermarking Underdevelopment**: Limited implementation of AI output detection systems

### 5. **Governance Structure Weaknesses**
- **Profit Pressure**: Financial incentives potentially undermining safety missions (noted for OpenAI transition)
- **Safety Culture Erosion**: Evidence of deteriorating safety culture in some organizations
- **Regulatory Avoidance**: Active lobbying against key safety regulations
- **Transparency Resistance**: Limited voluntary disclosure of safety practices and incidents

### 6. **Data and Privacy Vulnerabilities**
- **User Data Training**: Most companies training on user interaction data by default
- **Data Extraction Risks**: Potential for user data exposure through model behavior
- **Privacy Protection Gaps**: Limited implementation of robust user privacy protections

### 7. **Cross-Company Coordination Failures**
- **Information Sharing Barriers**: Limited coordination on safety practices between companies
- **Competitive Safety Disincentives**: Race dynamics discouraging safety investment
- **Standard Development Lag**: Slow development of industry-wide safety standards

## CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Most Concerning Gaps:
1. **Existential Safety Planning**: No company scored above D despite AGI timelines within decade
2. **Dangerous Capability Detection**: "Very low confidence" in timely detection of harmful capabilities
3. **Independent Verification**: Absence of third-party verification of safety claims
4. **Methodological Transparency**: Limited explanation of risk assessment approaches

### Industry-Wide Vulnerabilities:
- Voluntary self-regulation proving insufficient
- Competitive pressures outpacing safety infrastructure
- Limited external oversight and accountability mechanisms
- Gap between stated safety commitments and implementation
